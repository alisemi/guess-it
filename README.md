# guess-it
Description: This program is a game that involves basic concepts of optical physics in which a player can see how light
	     is reflected through space from different kinds of shapes. One will have to guess the shape of hidden objects
	     by analyzing the behavior of light waves around it. The program can also serve as a useful simulation software
	     to be used in schools by students and teachers to teach basic concepts of optics. This program can also serve
	     a significant base to further improved applications in the field of physics and education.

Current Status: Significantly functional with the exception of a few minor characteristics.
